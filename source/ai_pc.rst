Choosing the Right Processor for AI Tasks
=========================================

When deciding between CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs for specific AI tasks, it's crucial to understand the strengths and typical use cases for each type of processor:

- **CPU**:
  - Suitable for running generic workloads and a variety of tasks including embedding models, which don't require intensive parallel processing.

- **GPU**:
  - Recommended for tasks demanding high computational power, such as training or running inference on large language models (LLMs). GPUs benefit from their parallel processing capabilities, making them ideal for complex computations.

- **NPU**:
  - Optimal for sustained, low-power AI tasks such as background blurring on video calls. NPUs are designed for long-duration AI processes that require efficiency.

This setup leverages the distinct strengths of each processor type to maximize efficiency and performance in AI development and deployment on an Intel NUC.
